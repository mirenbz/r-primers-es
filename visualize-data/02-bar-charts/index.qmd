This tutorial will show you how to make and enhance **bar charts** with the {ggplot2} package. You will learn how to:

* make and interpret bar charts
* customize bar charts with **aesthetics** and **parameters**
* use **position adjustments**
* use **facets** to create subplots

The tutorial is adapted from [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the {ggplot2} and {dplyr} packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.
