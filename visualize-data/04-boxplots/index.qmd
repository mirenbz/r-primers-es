**Boxplots** display the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. **Count** plots display the relationship between two categorical variables. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use both. You will learn how to:

* Make and interpret boxplots
* Rotate boxplots by flipping the coordinate system of your plot
* Use *violin* plots and *dotplots*, two geoms that are similar to boxplots
* Make and interpret count plots

The tutorial is adapted from [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the {ggplot2} and {dplyr} packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.
