A **line graph** displays a functional relationship between two continuous variables. A **map**  displays spatial data. The two may seem different, but they are made in similar ways. This tutorial will examine them both.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

* Make new types of line plots with `geom_step()`, `geom_area()`, `geom_path()`, and `geom_polygon()`
* Avoid "whipsawing" with the group aesthetic
* Find and plot map data with `geom_sf()`
* Transform a coordinate system into a map projection with `coord_sf()`

The tutorial is adapted from [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the {ggplot2}, {sf}, and {dplyr} packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.
