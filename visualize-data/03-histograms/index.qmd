**Histograms** are the most popular way to visualize continuous distributions. Here we will look at them and their derivatives. You will learn how to:

* Make and interpret histograms
* Adjust the **binwidth** of a histogram to reveal new information
* Use geoms that are similar to histograms, such as __dotplots__, __frequency polygons__, and __densities__

The tutorial is adapted from [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the {ggplot2} and {dplyr} packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.
