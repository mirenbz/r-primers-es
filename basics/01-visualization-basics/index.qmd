Visualization is one of the most important tools for data science. 

It is also a great way to start learning R; when you visualize data, you get an immediate payoff that will keep you motivated as you learn. After all, learning a new language can be hard!

This tutorial will teach you how to visualize data with R's most popular visualization package, `ggplot2`.

### 

The tutorial focuses on three basic skills:

1. How to create graphs with a reusable **template**
1. How to add variables to a graph with **aesthetics**
1. How to make different "types" of graphs with **geoms** 

In this tutorial, we will use the [core tidyverse packages](http://tidyverse.org/), including `ggplot2`. I've already loaded the packages for you, so let's begin!
