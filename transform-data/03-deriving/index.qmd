In this case study, you will identify the most popular American names from 1880 to 2015. While doing this, you will master three more dplyr functions:

* `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()`, which help you use your data to compute new variables and summary statistics

These are some of the most useful R functions for data science, and this tutorial provides everything you need to learn them. 

This tutorial uses the [core tidyverse packages](http://tidyverse.org/), including {ggplot2}, {tibble}, and {dplyr}, as well as the `babynames` package. All of these packages have been pre-installed and pre-loaded for your convenience.
